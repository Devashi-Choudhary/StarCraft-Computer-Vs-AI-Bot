# StarCraft-Computer-Vs-AI-Bot
StarCraft is a strategic game where your AI bot plays against other players, or computers, where you start with a "base," which allows you to build basic units that collect resources. From here, you can build more buildings that unlock new units, like combat units, and then your objective is to amass an army to take out your opponent.
